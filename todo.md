## Phase 1: Backend Foundation

### 1.1. Initialize Supabase Project
- [x] ~~Create new Supabase project in dashboard~~

- [x] ~~Configure CORS: allow `http://localhost:3000` and any planned frontend URL~~

### 1.2. Define Database Schema & Tables
- [x] ~~Create table `workspaces` (id, name, created_by, created_at)~~
- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `workspaces` and add policies~~
- [x] ~~Create table `users` (id, auth_id, full_name, email, workspace_id, avatar_url, created_at)~~
- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `users` and add policies~~
- [x] ~~Create table `channels` (id, workspace_id, name, description, created_by, created_at, unique constraint)~~
- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `channels` and add policies~~
- [x] ~~Create table `messages` (id, workspace_id, channel_id, parent_message_id, user_id, content, created_at)~~
- [x] ~~Add indexes on `messages`~~
- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `messages` and add policies~~
- [x] ~~Create table `attachments` (id, workspace_id, channel_id, message_id, storage_path, filename, uploaded_by, uploaded_at)~~
- [x] ~~Add CHECK constraint and index on `attachments`~~
- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `attachments` and add policies~~

- [x] ~~Enable RLS on `user_channel_reads` and add policies~~

### 1.3. Create Custom RPC for Unread Count
- [x] ~~Define function `get_unread_count(p_user_id UUID, p_channel_id UUID)`~~
- [x] ~~Verify `SECURITY DEFINER` and function returns `unread_count`~~
- [x] ~~Test with sample data~~

### 1.4. Configure Supabase Storage Bucket
- [x] ~~Create private bucket named `attachments-bucket`~~
- [x] ~~Confirm bucket ACL is private~~
- [x] ~~Set public URL expiration defaults~~

## Phase 2: Backend Connectivity & APIs

### 2.1. Integrate Supabase JS Client
- [ ] Create Node.js project (or in React repo)
